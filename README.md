# `yaclt`

What is `yaclt`? It's <ins>**Y**</ins>et <ins>**A**</ins>nother <ins>**C**</ins>hange<ins>**L**</ins>og <ins>**T**</ins>ool.

`yaclt` is a file-based changelog generator. The idea is basically the following:

- For each pull request/merge request, include a changelog file generated by this tool -- it gets stored in source control until the next release
- To prepare a release, use the `prepare-release` command, which will:
  - Gather all the individual changelog entries into a global `CHANGELOG.md` (or whatever file you've specified)
  - Delete all the individual changelog files

The changelog entry format and the global changelog file template are both [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com) templates, and you can use the extra helpers from [`handlebars-helpers`](https://github.com/helpers/handlebars-helpers).

Help for each command can be found by running the command with the `--help` argument.
