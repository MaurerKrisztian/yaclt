# Contributing

To get started contributing, you'll need to following command line tools:

1. `git` - [download](https://git-scm.com/)
1. `yarn` - if you have Node installed, the easiest way is to `npm i -g yarn`.

## Setting Up Your Environment

1. Clone the project with `git`.
1. In the project directory, run `yarn` to install dependencies. **Ensure you see something like "husky hooks installed" in the output.** Code changes that have not been run through `prettier` and `eslint`, or command changes which do not update `COMMANDS.md` **will not pass the CI pipeline**. The Husky hooks should handle this all for you.
1. **Do not use the `npm` package manager, it will generate a `package-lock.json`. We use the `yarn` package manager and a `yarn.lock` file.**

## General Rules

1. As a general rule, do not write any Javascript. All code must be Typescript.
1. When creating a branch, use the following format: `yourname/1234-a-brief-description`. This should be self explanatory but: replace `yourname` with an identifier unique to you (name, GitHub username, etc.), replace `1234` with the issue number, and replace `a-brief-description` with a brief description of the issue you're working on.
1. Do not create Pull Requests which do not resolve an open issue. You may create an issue for your Pull Request, but please be sure to leave a comment that you are working on the issue.
1. Pull Requests must include a changelog generated by `yaclt`. You can either use the latest version globally installed, or run `yarn build; ./dist/index.js` as the command.
1. **Please be as detailed as possible when opening issues.**
